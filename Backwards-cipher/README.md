# Backwards-cipher

Prints a string backwards. The backwards cipher is usually used in conjunction with other ciphers for better security.

In the code there are two other methods for printing a string backwards, but they have been commented out (uncomment them depending on which you prefer to use).

## Example outputs

	Hello world!
	!dlrow olleH
	
---

	'Tis but a scratch!
	!hctarcs a tub siT'
